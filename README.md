Etch-a-Sketch 
Make a container grid 
Write 16x16 square grid of divs using flex box
Be careful with borders and margins
Add an hover effect so the doc change colors 
- when your mouse hover it leaves a pixelated trail
- make the radius of the mouse one grid (Iâ€™m thinking this should be assigned upon connecting each grid with hover and maybe use a random color effect for each hover into the grid)
- change grid color using class or JavaScript
